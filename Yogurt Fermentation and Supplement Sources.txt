1. CAN LACTOBACILLUS HILGARDII BE FERMENTED IN YOGURT?

Answer: NOT RECOMMENDED - NO DOCUMENTED SUCCESSFUL CASES FOUND

Internet Search Results (Comprehensive Search Conducted):
• EXTENSIVE SEARCH CONDUCTED: Searched forums, Reddit, blogs, fermentation communities, and academic databases
• RESULT: ZERO documented cases of individuals successfully fermenting yogurt with L. hilgardii
• No user experiences found on Reddit, fermentation forums, or home fermentation blogs
• No recipes, tutorials, or success stories found
• No documented attempts (successful or failed) found in community discussions

Temperature Range: [32°F - 86-99°F - 122°F] (from your Conspiracy Probiotics.txt)
• Optimal Temperature: 86-99°F (overlaps with yogurt fermentation range of 95-105°F)
• Temperature compatibility: Theoretically possible, but no evidence of success

Specialization: L. hilgardii is primarily associated with:
• Wine and beer fermentation (primary use)
• Silage fermentation (corn, sorghum - agricultural use)
• GABA production in specific fermentation processes (silkworm pupae, non-dairy)
• NOT dairy or yogurt fermentation

Research Findings:
• Studies show L. hilgardii used in silage fermentation (animal feed)
• Studies show L. hilgardii used in wine/beer fermentation
• Studies show L. hilgardii used in GABA production from non-dairy substrates
• NO studies or documented cases of L. hilgardii in yogurt or dairy fermentation
• Academic research consistently recommends traditional yogurt cultures (S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus)

Why No One Has Tried It (or Documented It):
• Adapted to wine/beer environments (different pH, sugars, nutrients than dairy)
• Not designed for lactose fermentation in milk
• May not produce desirable yogurt texture, flavor, or acidity
• May not compete well with standard yogurt cultures
• Limited research on human probiotic benefits
• Not commercially available as yogurt starter culture

Verdict: After extensive internet searching, NO documented cases of people making yogurt with L. hilgardii were found. This strongly suggests it's either never been attempted, or all attempts have failed/not been documented. The complete absence of user experiences, recipes, or discussions indicates this is not a viable approach. The temperature range overlaps, but L. hilgardii is specialized for alcoholic and agricultural fermentation, not dairy. NOT RECOMMENDED.

2. CAN LACTOBACILLUS KUNKEEI BE FERMENTED IN YOGURT?

Answer: NOT RECOMMENDED - NO DOCUMENTED SUCCESSFUL CASES FOUND

Internet Search Results (Comprehensive Search Conducted):
• EXTENSIVE SEARCH CONDUCTED: Searched forums, Reddit, blogs, fermentation communities, and academic databases
• RESULT: ZERO documented cases of individuals successfully fermenting yogurt with L. kunkeei
• No user experiences found on Reddit, fermentation forums, or home fermentation blogs
• No recipes, tutorials, or success stories found
• No documented attempts (successful or failed) found in community discussions

Temperature Range: [32°F - 68-86°F - 113°F] (from your Conspiracy Probiotics.txt)
• Optimal Temperature: 68-86°F (LOWER than typical yogurt fermentation at 100°F)
• Maximum Survival: 113°F (could theoretically survive at 100°F, but not optimal)
• Temperature compatibility: Suboptimal - optimal range is too low for standard yogurt fermentation

Specialization: L. kunkeei is primarily associated with:
• Honeybee products (honey, bee pollen, bee bread, royal jelly) - PRIMARY HABITAT
• Honey bee gut microbiome (not human gut)
• Grape juice fermentations (where it's considered a SPOILAGE organism)
• Fructophilic (prefers fructose, NOT lactose - major problem for dairy fermentation)
• NOT dairy or yogurt fermentation

Key Research Findings:
• L. kunkeei is FRUCTOPHILIC - it prefers fructose, not lactose (milk's primary sugar)
• Studies show L. kunkeei in honeybee products (honey, pollen, royal jelly)
• Studies show L. kunkeei as spoilage organism in grape juice fermentations
• Heat-killed L. kunkeei YB38 from bee pollen shown to enhance IgA production in humans (probiotic potential, but not for yogurt)
• NO studies or documented cases of L. kunkeei in yogurt or dairy fermentation
• Academic research consistently recommends traditional yogurt cultures

Critical Issue - Fructophilic Nature:
• L. kunkeei is adapted to ferment FRUCTOSE (fruit sugars, honey)
• Milk contains LACTOSE (dairy sugar)
• L. kunkeei may NOT be able to effectively ferment lactose
• This is a fundamental metabolic incompatibility with dairy fermentation

Why No One Has Tried It (or Documented It):
• Optimal temperature (68-86°F) is too low for standard yogurt fermentation (100°F)
• Fructophilic nature - prefers fructose, not lactose (milk's sugar)
• Adapted to honey/sugar environments, not dairy
• Associated with honey bee microbiome, not human gut or dairy
• Limited research on human probiotic benefits
• Not commercially available as yogurt starter culture
• May not produce desirable yogurt texture, flavor, or acidity

Verdict: After extensive internet searching, NO documented cases of people making yogurt with L. kunkeei were found. This strongly suggests it's either never been attempted, or all attempts have failed/not been documented. The complete absence of user experiences, recipes, or discussions indicates this is not a viable approach. Additionally, L. kunkeei's fructophilic nature (preferring fructose over lactose) creates a fundamental metabolic incompatibility with dairy fermentation. The optimal temperature is also too low for standard yogurt making. NOT RECOMMENDED.

3. SOURCES FOR BIFIDOBACTERIUM INFANTIS AND BIFIDOBACTERIUM ADOLESCENTIS

BIFIDOBACTERIUM INFANTIS:

Common Sources:
• Culturelle Digestive Health Daily Probiotic (contains B. infantis along with L. rhamnosus)
• Swanson Probiotics (various formulations may contain B. infantis)
• iHerb (search for "Bifidobacterium infantis" - multiple brands available)
• Amazon (search for "Bifidobacterium infantis probiotic")
• Align Probiotic (contains B. infantis M-63)
• Jarrow Formulas Bifidus Balance (contains B. infantis)

Note: B. infantis is more commonly available than B. adolescentis. Look for products specifically listing "Bifidobacterium infantis" or "B. infantis" on the label.

BIFIDOBACTERIUM ADOLESCENTIS:

Less Common - Harder to Find:
• Element Longevity (contains B. adolescentis iVS-1 strain) - This appears to be one of the few commercial sources
• iHerb (search for "Bifidobacterium adolescentis" - very limited options)
• Amazon (search "Bifidobacterium adolescentis" - very few products)
• Some specialized probiotic formulations may contain it, but it's not commonly available

Note: B. adolescentis is MUCH harder to find than B. infantis. The iVS-1 strain from Element Longevity appears to be one of the primary commercial sources. This may be why it's not discussed in Super Gut community - it's simply not readily available in supplements.

Recommendation:
• For B. infantis: Check iHerb, Swanson, or Amazon for best prices
• For B. adolescentis: Element Longevity appears to be one of the few reliable sources; expect higher prices due to rarity

• L. paracasei (sometimes in multi-strain products)
• B. breve (sometimes in multi-strain products)
• B. infantis (more available - see above)
• S. boulardii (widely available as single-strain or in multi-strain)
• B. subtilis (see below)

Best Approach:
• Search for "multi-strain probiotic" on iHerb, Swanson, or Amazon
• Look for products with 10+ strains that may include some of these
• Many products list their strains on the label
• Note: Most commercial multi-strain probiotics focus on the most researched strains (L. acidophilus, L. casei, B. bifidum, B. lactis, B. longum, L. rhamnosus, etc.) - which are already in your recipe

Specific Recommendations:
• Garden of Life RAW Probiotics (contains many strains, may include some from your list)
• Renew Life Ultimate Flora (multi-strain, may include some from your list)
• Dr. Mercola Complete Probiotics (multi-strain)
• Check labels carefully - many products don't list all the strains you're looking for

5. BACILLUS SUBTILIS: SUPPLEMENTS AND YOGURT FERMENTATION

CAN YOU FERMENT B. SUBTILIS IN YOGURT INSTEAD OF B. COAGULANS?

Answer: YES, BUT WITH CONSIDERATIONS

From your Super Gut Community Probiotic Information.txt:
• Dr. Davis has discussed B. subtilis as beneficial
• Dr. Davis mentions B. subtilis can be sourced from kombucha products (VitaLife Organic Kombucha at Aldi's)
• Dr. Davis notes B. subtilis helps suppress harmful bacteria and fungi and protects probiotic Lactobacillus species
• Dr. Davis notes B. subtilis is preferable to B. coagulans for some fermentation purposes

Temperature Range (from Conspiracy Probiotics.txt):
• B. subtilis: [50°F - 77-99°F - 113°F]
• B. coagulans: [100-115°F] (from your recipe)
• Your recipe ferments at 100°F

Considerations:
• B. subtilis optimal temp (77-99°F) is slightly lower than your recipe temp (100°F), but within the maximum survival range (113°F)
• B. subtilis is spore-forming (heat resistant), so it should survive at 100°F
• Dr. Davis prefers B. subtilis over B. coagulans for some purposes
• B. subtilis may provide protective benefits for other probiotics in your yogurt

Verdict: YES, you can likely use B. subtilis instead of B. coagulans. The temperature is compatible (100°F is within B. subtilis's range), and Dr. Davis has indicated preference for B. subtilis in some contexts. You may want to experiment with a batch to see how it performs.

BACILLUS SUBTILIS SUPPLEMENT SOURCES:

Option 1: Kombucha (as mentioned by Dr. Davis)
• VitaLife Organic Kombucha (at Aldi's) - Dr. Davis specifically mentions this
• Other kombucha products may contain B. subtilis naturally
• Note: Kombucha also contains other organisms (yeasts, bacteria) that may affect fermentation

Option 2: Probiotic Supplements
• Swanson Probiotics (may have B. subtilis formulations)
• iHerb (search for "Bacillus subtilis probiotic")
• Amazon (search "Bacillus subtilis probiotic supplement")
• Some soil-based probiotic formulations contain B. subtilis
• Megasporebiotic (contains B. subtilis among other Bacillus species)
• Just Thrive Probiotic (contains B. subtilis)

Option 3: Spore-Based Probiotics
• Many "soil-based organism" (SBO) probiotics contain B. subtilis
• These are often marketed as "spore probiotics" or "SBO probiotics"

Recommendation:
• Easiest: Try VitaLife Organic Kombucha from Aldi's (as Dr. Davis suggests) - you can use a small amount as a starter
• Most Reliable: Purchase a B. subtilis probiotic supplement (check iHerb or Amazon for best prices)
• For yogurt: You'll need a supplement with live B. subtilis spores (not heat-killed)

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

SUMMARY:

• L. hilgardii: Not recommended for yogurt (specialized for wine/beer)
• L. kunkeei: Not recommended for yogurt (optimal temp too low, specialized for honey)
• B. infantis: Available from Culturelle, Swanson, iHerb, Amazon
• B. adolescentis: Very limited - Element Longevity (iVS-1 strain) is one of few sources
• Multi-strain supplements: Most don't contain many of the probiotics from your "not in recipe" list
• B. subtilis: YES, can replace B. coagulans in yogurt; sources include kombucha (VitaLife at Aldi's) or probiotic supplements
