NOTES ON TEMPERATURE RANGES:

•   Most Lactobacillus species: 95-115°F (35-46°C) with optimal around 98-100°F (37-38°C)
•   Most Bifidobacterium species: 96-100°F (36-38°C) with optimal at 98.6°F (37°C)
•   Thermotolerant strains (S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus): 104-115°F (40-46°C)
•   Spore-forming Bacillus species: Can tolerate higher temperatures (up to 140°F/60°C)
•   Yeast probiotics: Lower temperatures, 86-98.6°F (30-37°C)

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

•   Strain-specific benefits: Different strains within the same species may have different benefits
•   Temperature ranges may vary by specific strain and manufacturer
•   Multi-strain fermentation: When combining strains, use a temperature that works for all (typically 95-105°F/35-41°C)
•   Fermentation time: Longer fermentation (24-36+ hours) generally increases CFU counts
•   Prebiotics: Adding prebiotics (inulin, FOS) helps feed probiotics during fermentation
•   Individual responses vary: Consult healthcare professionals before starting new probiotic regimens
