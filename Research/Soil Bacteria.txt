Soil Bacteria

This document lists soil bacteria with potential probiotic benefits, their key benefits, why they're underrecognized, and natural sources of exposure.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Bacillus subtilis (e.g., strains CU1, DE111, HU58)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Produces enzymes for nutrient breakdown, fights pathogens like S. aureus; boosts secretory IgA for barrier integrity
• Immune: Stimulates T-cells, reduces respiratory infections in elderly
• Potential: Butyrate-like anti-inflammatory could curb chronic issues tied to microbiome disruption (e.g., early cancer shielding via oxidative stress control)

Why Underrecognized:
• Touted for plant growth/ferments (natto), not human supplements
• Safety GRAS but trials niche (e.g., IBS relief noted anecdotally in Asia)

Sources of Exposure:
• Organic veggies' dirt
• Natto
• Soil-based supplements

Where to Buy:
• Soil-based probiotic supplements (Megasporebiotic, Just Thrive Probiotic, Prescript Assist)
• Kombucha (VitaLife Organic Kombucha at Aldi's - contains B. subtilis naturally)
• iHerb, Amazon (search "Bacillus subtilis probiotic")
• Swanson Probiotics (may have B. subtilis formulations)
• Note: Specific strains (CU1, DE111, HU58) may not be labeled - most products list as "B. subtilis" only

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: POSSIBLE BUT NOT STANDARD - EXPERIMENTAL

Why It Could Work:
• Spore-forming (heat resistant) - can survive pasteurization
• Temperature range: [50°F - 77-99°F - 113°F] (from Conspiracy Probiotics.txt)
• Optimal temp 77-99°F overlaps with yogurt fermentation range
• Used in natto fermentation (fermented soybeans)
• Dr. Davis has discussed B. subtilis as beneficial and mentions it can be sourced from kombucha

Why It's Not Standard:
• Not traditionally used in yogurt fermentation
• Limited documented cases of yogurt fermentation with B. subtilis
• May not produce typical yogurt texture/flavor
• Typically used in natto, not dairy

Verdict: B. subtilis CAN potentially be fermented in yogurt (temperature compatible, spore-forming), but it's not standard practice. It's more commonly used in natto fermentation. Dr. Davis has mentioned it can be sourced from kombucha. If attempting, use as adjunct culture alongside proven yogurt strains, not as primary culture.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[Y] Bacillus coagulans (e.g., strains GBI-30,6086, MTCC 5856, Unique IS-2)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Eases IBS bloating/diarrhea, survives antibiotics to restore diversity
• Immune: Enhances NK cells, modulates allergies
• Potential: Antioxidant production hints at detox from food toxins; understudied for zinc synergy in preventing proliferative diseases

Why Underrecognized:
• Branded as "spore probiotic" in pet food more than human
• Benefits seen in athlete recovery but not hyped for gut-cancer links

Sources of Exposure:
• Fermented soy
• Soil-enriched grains
• Targeted supplements

Where to Buy:
• Digestive Advantage (contains B. coagulans GBI-30,6086 - this is in your recipe)
• Swanson Probiotics
• iHerb, Amazon (search "Bacillus coagulans probiotic")
• Available in many probiotic supplements
• Note: GBI-30,6086 strain is the most commonly available

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: YES - ALREADY IN YOUR RECIPE

Why It Works:
• Spore-forming (heat resistant)
• Temperature range: 100-115°F (from your recipe)
• Your recipe ferments at 100°F, which is within B. coagulans range
• Already proven to work in your Super Gut SIBO Yogurt Recipe
• Studies show B. coagulans can be used as adjunct starter culture in yogurt

Verdict: YES, B. coagulans CAN be fermented in yogurt - you're already doing it! It's in your recipe as one of the core Super Gut probiotics. Temperature compatible, spore-forming nature allows survival through fermentation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Bacillus clausii (e.g., strains O/C, UBBC-07, SC-109)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Repairs leaky gut, crowds out C. diff post-antibiotics
• Immune: Anti-inflammatory in autoimmune models
• Potential: Increases butyrate for colon protection; noticed in traveler's diarrhea fixes but ignored for broader oncology prevention

Why Underrecognized:
• Common in Asian meds (e.g., Enterogermina) as "enteric prep," not probiotic label
• Safety stellar but research siloed to GI

Sources of Exposure:
• Soil
• Dairy ferments
• Multi-strain supplements

Where to Buy:
• Enterogermina (Sanofi) - available in many countries, especially Asia/Latin America
• Some multi-strain soil-based probiotics may contain B. clausii
• iHerb, Amazon (search "Bacillus clausii" - limited availability)
• Note: More commonly available outside the US (popular in Europe, Asia, Latin America)

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: POSSIBLE BUT NOT DOCUMENTED

Why It Could Work:
• Spore-forming (heat resistant)
• Bacillus species generally tolerate yogurt fermentation temperatures
• Used as probiotic in Enterogermina (spore form)
• Temperature requirements likely compatible with yogurt range

Why It's Not Standard:
• Not commonly used in yogurt fermentation
• Limited documented cases
• More commonly consumed as supplement (spores) rather than fermented
• Research focused on GI benefits when consumed as supplement

Verdict: B. clausii MIGHT be fermentable in yogurt (spore-forming Bacillus, likely temperature compatible), but there's no documented evidence of yogurt fermentation. It's typically consumed as a supplement (spores) rather than fermented. Would be experimental.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Bacillus licheniformis (e.g., strain SL-307)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Degrades antinutrients, supports vitamin K/B12 synthesis
• Immune: Boosts IgA, fights fungal overgrowth
• Potential: Enzyme output aids heavy metal chelation; benefits pop in skin health anecdotes but untapped for microbiome-mediated detox/cancer starve

Why Underrecognized:
• Used in industrial enzymes, not supplements
• Controversial safety in some reviews, keeping it low-profile

Sources of Exposure:
• Soil
• Fermented feeds
• Rare human blends

Where to Buy:
• Very limited availability in commercial supplements
• Some specialized soil-based probiotics may contain it
• May need to purchase from culture collections (ATCC, DSMZ) for pure cultures
• Note: Rarely found in consumer probiotic products due to safety concerns

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: NOT RECOMMENDED - SAFETY CONCERNS

Why It's Risky:
• Controversial safety profile
• Some reviews flag safety concerns
• Used in industrial enzymes, not food fermentation
• Limited research on human probiotic use
• Not approved for yogurt/food fermentation

Verdict: B. licheniformis is NOT recommended for yogurt fermentation due to safety concerns and lack of documented safe use in food fermentation. It's primarily used industrially, not as a probiotic.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Clostridium butyricum (e.g., strain MIYAIRI 588)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Ferments fiber to butyrate for energy/anti-inflammatory
• Immune: Reduces H. pylori side effects, balances post-birth microbiome
• Potential: Butyrate's HDAC inhibition could preempt tumor formation; revered in Japanese tonics for digestion but not Western "probiotic" status

Why Underrecognized:
• Soil/veggie native, but spore risks flagged
• Huge in Asia for infant colic, overlooked globally for adult chronic disease

Sources of Exposure:
• Beets/veggies
• Kvass-like ferments
• Asian supplements

Note: Now classified as Anaerobutyricum butyricum in some taxonomies

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: NO - NOT SUITABLE FOR YOGURT FERMENTATION

Why Not:
• STRICTLY ANAEROBIC - Requires completely oxygen-free environment
• Yogurt fermentation involves exposure to air/oxygen
• Traditional yogurt uses facultative anaerobes (can tolerate oxygen)
• C. butyricum will not grow or may die in aerobic conditions

Fermentation Requirements:
• Temperature: Optimal around 37°C (98.6°F)
• pH: Initial pH of 7.5-9.0
• Environment: STRICT anaerobic conditions (no oxygen)
• Media: Requires specific nutrients (glucose, pectin, soybean cake extract, casein, etc.)
• CO₂: Carbon dioxide can help initiate growth

What It Can Ferment:
• Can ferment carbohydrates into butyric acid
• Produces byproducts: hydrogen gas, CO₂, acetate
• Used in industrial butyric acid production
• Used in biofuel production (butanol)

Safety Concerns:
• Some strains carry botulinum neurotoxin genes
• Must use safe, tested probiotic strains (like MIYAIRI 588)
• Requires careful strain selection
• Not recommended for home fermentation due to anaerobic requirements and safety risks

Verdict: While C. butyricum CAN be fermented under strict laboratory anaerobic conditions, it is NOT suitable for yogurt or any home fermentation that involves oxygen exposure. It's an obligate anaerobe, meaning it will not survive in normal yogurt-making conditions. The benefits come from consuming it as a supplement (spores), not from fermenting it yourself.

Where to Buy:
• Japanese supplements (MIYA-BM - contains strain MIYAIRI 588)
• Asian probiotic formulations
• Very limited availability in Western markets
• iHerb, Amazon (search "Clostridium butyricum" or "Anaerobutyricum butyricum" - very few products)
• Note: More readily available in Japan/Asia than in US/Europe

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Enterococcus faecium (e.g., strains SF68, L3)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Tackles diarrhea, aids weight gain in malnourished kids
• Immune: Antimicrobial against E. coli
• Potential: pH modulation starves pathogens; noticed in animal feed success but human use controversial due to resistance fears, hiding broader gut-fortifying role

Why Underrecognized:
• Dual-edged (some strains pathogenic)
• Benefits in vet probiotics, human trials sparse beyond IBS

Sources of Exposure:
• Soil near farms
• Animal-derived foods

Note: Use caution - some strains are pathogenic

Where to Buy:
• Very limited availability due to safety concerns
• Some veterinary probiotics may contain E. faecium
• Not commonly recommended for human consumption
• Note: Use extreme caution - many strains are pathogenic; benefits seen in specific probiotic strains only

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: NOT RECOMMENDED - SAFETY RISKS

Why It's Risky:
• Many strains are PATHOGENIC
• Some strains cause infections
• Human use controversial due to antibiotic resistance concerns
• Benefits only seen in specific tested probiotic strains (SF68, L3)
• Not standard for food fermentation

Verdict: E. faecium is NOT recommended for yogurt fermentation due to safety risks. While some specific probiotic strains (SF68, L3) have shown benefits, many strains are pathogenic. The risk outweighs potential benefits for home fermentation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Bacillus pumilus (e.g., Ribospore strain)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Promotes diversity, resists overgrowth
• Immune: Phage-like multiplier for good bugs
• Potential: Colonization resistance could block early metastatic niches; emerging in synbiotics, but soil roots keep it under radar

Why Underrecognized:
• Newer isolate for aquaculture
• Human data thin, benefits inferred from plant analogs

Sources of Exposure:
• Wild-harvested prebiotics
• Advanced supplements

Where to Buy:
• Very limited availability in commercial supplements
• Some advanced synbiotic formulations may contain B. pumilus
• May need to purchase from culture collections (ATCC, DSMZ) for pure cultures
• Note: Newer to the probiotic market, human data is limited

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: UNKNOWN - NOT DOCUMENTED

Why It's Uncertain:
• Newer to probiotic market
• Human data very limited
• Benefits inferred from plant analogs, not human studies
• Spore-forming Bacillus species, so theoretically could survive fermentation
• No documented cases of yogurt fermentation

Verdict: B. pumilus fermentation in yogurt is UNKNOWN - no documented cases. As a spore-forming Bacillus, it might survive fermentation, but there's no evidence it would work or be safe. Too new to the market to recommend for home fermentation.

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════

[N] Streptomyces spp. (various environmental strains)

Key Benefits:
• Gut: Produces antimicrobials (e.g., streptomycin analogs)
• Immune: Anti-fungal/viral hints
• Potential: Secondary metabolites for broad detox; antibiotic origins hide probiotic angle, but could synergize with ivermectin-like compounds

Why Underrecognized:
• Famous for drugs, not live probiotics
• Understudied for direct ingestion benefits

Sources of Exposure:
• Forest/organic soils
• Minimal direct exposure

Where to Buy:
• NOT available in commercial probiotic supplements
• Streptomyces are primarily known for producing antibiotics (streptomycin, etc.)
• Not sold as live probiotics for human consumption
• Would need to obtain from culture collections (ATCC, DSMZ) for research purposes
• Note: Not recommended for probiotic use - these are antibiotic-producing organisms, not typically consumed as live probiotics

Can It Be Fermented in Yogurt?
Answer: NO - NOT RECOMMENDED

Why Not:
• Antibiotic-producing organisms - would kill other probiotics
• Not designed for food fermentation
• No documented probiotic use
• Would interfere with yogurt fermentation (kills lactic acid bacteria)
• Not sold as live probiotics

Verdict: Streptomyces CANNOT and SHOULD NOT be fermented in yogurt. They produce antibiotics that would kill the beneficial bacteria needed for yogurt fermentation. They're not probiotics - they're antibiotic producers.
