SOURCES IN KNOWN PROBIOTICS
================================================================================

1. LACTOBACILLUS BUCHNERI
   From Known Probiotics:
   • Optimal Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)
   • Full Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)
   • Sources: 
     - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lentilactobacillus_buchneri
     - https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/10/6/298
   
   VERDICT: According to Known Probiotics, maximum is 98°F (37°C)
   • At 99°F: Would be ABOVE maximum → DIES

2. LACTOBACILLUS CURVATUS
   From Known Probiotics:
   • Optimal Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)
   • Full Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)
   • Sources:

     - https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC9834086/
   
   VERDICT: According to Known Probiotics, maximum is 98°F (37°C)
   • At 99°F: Would be ABOVE maximum → DIES

3. LACTOBACILLUS SAKEI
   From Known Probiotics:
   • Optimal Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)
   • Full Temperature Range: 86-98°F (30-37°C)

DISCREPANCY FOUND
================================================================================

CONFLICTING INFORMATION:

Milk Probiotics.txt shows:
• L. buchneri: [59F - 86-104F - 111F]
  Source: "Lactobacillus brevis, plantarum, fermentum, pentosus, buchneri: 
          Min 15°C (59°F), Opt 30-40°C (86-104°F), Max 44°C (111°F)"
  From: Editverse - Probiotic Strain Selection and Growth Kinetics in Dairy Fermentation
  URL: https://editverse.com/probiotic-strain-selection-and-growth-kinetics-in-dairy-fermentation/

This suggests L. buchneri can survive up to 111°F (44°C), NOT 98°F!

KNOWN PROBIOTICS shows:
• L. buchneri: Maximum 98°F (37°C)
  Sources: Wikipedia and MDPI article

WHICH IS CORRECT?

The Known Probiotics file appears to have more specific, peer-reviewed sources:
- MDPI article (peer-reviewed journal)
- Wikipedia (with citations)

The Milk Probiotics source groups L. buchneri with other Lactobacillus species 
and may be using a general range rather than species-specific data.

RECOMMENDATION: Trust the Known Probiotics file as it has:
1. More specific sources (MDPI peer-reviewed article)
2. Species-specific data (not grouped with other species)
3. Wikipedia with citations

However, there IS a discrepancy that should be resolved.

VERIFICATION RESULT
================================================================================

According to the scientific sources in Known Probiotics:

✅ YES, all three will die at 99°F:

1. L. buchneri: Maximum 98°F → 99°F is above maximum → DIES
2. L. curvatus: Maximum 98°F → 99°F is above maximum → DIES  
3. L. sakei: Maximum 98°F → 99°F is above maximum → DIES

At 98°F:
✅ All three SURVIVE (98°F is at their maximum limit, but within range)

SOURCES VERIFIED:
• L. buchneri: Wikipedia + MDPI article (https://www.mdpi.com/2311-5637/10/6/298)
• L. curvatus: MDPI article + NCBI article
• L. sakei: MDPI article + NCBI article

NOTE: There is a discrepancy with Milk Probiotics.txt which suggests L. buchneri 
can survive up to 111°F. The Known Probiotics file appears more reliable with 
peer-reviewed sources and species-specific data.
