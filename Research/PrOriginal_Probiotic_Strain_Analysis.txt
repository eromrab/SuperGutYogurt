KEY FINDINGS
================================================================================

1. STRAIN SPECIFICATIONS - NOT DISCLOSED
   • PrOriginal does NOT specify which specific strains of L. reuteri and L. gasseri it contains
   • Only lists species names: "L. reuteri" and "L. gasseri"
   • No strain designations (e.g., DSM 17938, ATCC PTA 6475, BNR17) provided
   • No individual CFU counts per strain disclosed

2. CFU DISTRIBUTION
   • Total: 120 billion CFUs per capsule
   • 36 strains total
   • Average per strain: ~3.3 billion CFUs
   • Actual distribution: Unknown (likely not equal)

3. COMPARISON TO RECIPE REQUIREMENTS
   Recipe Needs:
   • L. reuteri: 10 billion CFUs (strains DSM 17938 & ATCC PTA 6475)
   • L. gasseri: 10-20 billion CFUs (strain BNR17)
   
   PrOriginal Likely Provides:
   • L. reuteri: ~3.3 billion CFUs (average, unknown strain)
   • L. gasseri: ~3.3 billion CFUs (average, unknown strain)
   
   VERDICT: Insufficient CFUs and unknown strains

4. MULTIPLE CAPSULE ANALYSIS
   Current Setup (1 capsule):
   • ~3.3 billion CFUs per strain (average)
   • Below recipe target of 10-20 billion CFUs per strain
   
   With 2 Capsules:
   • ~6.6 billion CFUs per strain (average)
   • Closer to target, but still below 10 billion minimum
   
   With 3 Capsules:
   • ~10 billion CFUs per strain (average)
   • Meets minimum target for average strains
   • ⚠️ Creates equal CFU competition for L. reuteri and L. gasseri:
     - PrOriginal L. reuteri: ~10 billion (unknown strain) = MyReuteri: 10 billion (specific strains)
     - PrOriginal L. gasseri: ~10 billion (unknown strain) = Biothin: 10-20 billion (BNR17)
     - Unknown strains may compete more effectively with equal starting CFUs
   
   Considerations:
   • 36-hour fermentation allows significant multiplication (10-100x increase)
   • Starting with more CFUs = better initial colonization
   • Some strains may multiply better than others
   • Cost: 2-3x more expensive per batch
   • The recipe already works with current setup (strains multiply during fermentation)
   • ⚠️ Competition risk: Equal CFU counts make it harder for specific strains to dominate

================================================================================
COMPETITION ANALYSIS
================================================================================

RESEARCH FINDINGS ON PROBIOTIC COMPETITION:

1. COEXISTENCE IS POSSIBLE
   • Studies show L. reuteri and L. gasseri can coexist with other probiotic strains
   • No significant antagonism observed between these species and other probiotics
   • L. reuteri has been shown to inhibit pathogen adhesion without negatively 
     affecting beneficial bacteria
   • L. gasseri demonstrates anti-inflammatory properties and compatibility in 
     multi-strain supplements

2. STRAIN-LEVEL CONSIDERATIONS
   • Different strains of the same species (e.g., L. reuteri DSM 17938 vs. 
     unknown L. reuteri strain) may have different:
     - Growth rates
     - Temperature optima
     - Metabolic activities
     - Competitive advantages
   
   • In yogurt fermentation at 99°F:
     - Strains better adapted to the temperature may outcompete others
     - The specific strains (DSM 17938, ATCC PTA 6475, BNR17) are selected 
       for their performance at this temperature
     - Unknown strains from PrOriginal may not perform as well

3. SYNERGISTIC EFFECTS
   • Multiple strains can work synergistically
   • Some combinations enhance overall probiotic efficacy
   • Broad-spectrum blends (like PrOriginal) are designed to work together

4. POTENTIAL CONCERNS
   • If PrOriginal contains different strains of L. reuteri/L. gasseri:
     - They may compete for resources (lactose, nutrients) during fermentation
     - The unknown strains may not be optimized for 99°F fermentation
     - Lower CFU counts from PrOriginal may be outcompeted by higher CFU 
       counts from MyReuteri/Biothin
   
   • However, research suggests this competition is generally not harmful
   - The stronger/more adapted strains will dominate
   - This is actually beneficial if the specific strains (DSM 17938, etc.) 
     are the ones that dominate

================================================================================
RECOMMENDATIONS
================================================================================

1. CONTINUE USING MYREUTERI AND BIOTHIN
   Reasons:
   • Ensures correct strains (DSM 17938, ATCC PTA 6475, BNR17)
   • Provides adequate CFUs (10+ billion each)
   • Strains are specifically selected for 99°F yogurt fermentation
   • Documented benefits for SIBO yogurt

2. PRORIGINAL CAN BE USED FOR OTHER 34 STRAINS
   • Provides the remaining 34 probiotics needed
   • Cost-effective way to get broad spectrum
   • Competition from PrOriginal's L. reuteri/L. gasseri is unlikely to be 
     problematic because:
     - Lower CFU counts (likely ~3.3 billion each)
     - Unknown strains may not be as well-adapted to 99°F
     - The specific strains from MyReuteri/Biothin will likely dominate

3. IF YOU WANT TO TEST USING ONLY PRORIGINAL:
   • Contact PrOriginal customer service to ask:
     - Which specific strains of L. reuteri and L. gasseri are included
     - Individual CFU counts for these two strains

   • If they can't provide this information, stick with MyReuteri/Biothin
   • If they provide different strains, those may not have the same benefits

================================================================================
CONCLUSION
================================================================================

The L. reuteri and L. gasseri in PrOriginal are unlikely to significantly 
compete with or interfere with MyReuteri and Biothin because:

1. PrOriginal likely provides much lower CFU counts (~3.3 billion vs. 10+ billion)
2. The specific strains in MyReuteri/Biothin are optimized for 99°F fermentation
3. Research shows these species can coexist without harmful competition
4. If competition occurs, the better-adapted strains (from MyReuteri/Biothin) 
   will dominate, which is desirable

However, PrOriginal cannot replace MyReuteri/Biothin because:
1. Unknown specific strains (may not be DSM 17938, ATCC PTA 6475, or BNR17)
2. Insufficient CFU counts (likely ~3.3 billion vs. required 10+ billion)
3. No guarantee of the documented benefits associated with specific strains

RECOMMENDATION: Continue using all three products together. The PrOriginal 
L. reuteri and L. gasseri will likely be outcompeted by the specific strains 
from MyReuteri/Biothin, which is actually beneficial for achieving the desired 
therapeutic effects.

SHOULD YOU USE MORE THAN 1 CAPSULE?
================================================================================

ANALYSIS:

Current Situation (1 capsule):
• Provides ~3.3 billion CFUs per strain (average)
• Recipe calls for 10-20 billion CFUs per strain
• During 36-hour fermentation, probiotics multiply 10-100x
• Your recipe already works with this setup

Using 2 Capsules:
• Provides ~6.6 billion CFUs per strain (average)
• Pros: Closer to target, better initial colonization, more diversity
• Cons: 2x cost, may be unnecessary if fermentation multiplies well

Using 3 Capsules:
• Provides ~10 billion CFUs per strain (average)
• Pros: Meets minimum target, maximum initial colonization
• Cons: 3x cost, likely overkill given 36-hour multiplication

RECOMMENDATION:

OPTION 1: Stick with 1 capsule (RECOMMENDED)
• Your recipe already works
• 36-hour fermentation allows significant multiplication
• Cost-effective
• If fermentation is working well, no need to change

OPTION 2: Use 2 capsules (IF YOU WANT EXTRA INSURANCE)
• Better for strains that don't multiply as well
• Provides more diversity and better initial colonization
• Still cost-effective (2x instead of 3x)
• Good middle ground if you're concerned about survival

OPTION 3: Use 3 capsules (ONLY IF HAVING ISSUES - WITH CAUTION)
• Only if you notice weak fermentation or low CFU counts in final product
• Maximum starting CFUs
• Most expensive option
• ⚠️ COMPETITION CONCERN: With 3 capsules, PrOriginal would provide:
  - L. reuteri: ~10 billion CFUs (unknown strain) vs MyReuteri's 10 billion (DSM 17938 & ATCC PTA 6475)
  - L. gasseri: ~10 billion CFUs (unknown strain) vs Biothin's 10-20 billion (BNR17)
  - This creates equal or near-equal CFU competition between specific and unknown strains
  - Unknown strains may compete more effectively with equal starting CFUs
  - The specific strains (DSM 17938, ATCC PTA 6475, BNR17) are optimized for 99°F, but 
    competition is less predictable with equal CFU counts
  - RECOMMENDATION: Avoid 3 capsules unless absolutely necessary, as it increases 
    competition risk for the core therapeutic strains

FACTORS TO CONSIDER:
• Are your batches fermenting well? (Thick, tangy, good texture)
• Are you seeing desired health benefits?
• Cost per batch (1 capsule vs 2-3 capsules)
• The 36-hour fermentation multiplies CFUs significantly

BOTTOM LINE: If your current yogurt is fermenting well and you're seeing 
benefits, 1 capsule is sufficient. The 36-hour fermentation allows the 
probiotics to multiply from ~3.3 billion to potentially 30-330 billion per 
strain. If you want extra insurance or notice weak fermentation, try 2 
capsules. 

⚠️ IMPORTANT: Avoid using 3 capsules unless absolutely necessary, as it creates 
equal CFU competition (10 billion vs 10 billion) between:
- PrOriginal's unknown L. reuteri strain vs MyReuteri's DSM 17938 & ATCC PTA 6475
- PrOriginal's unknown L. gasseri strain vs Biothin's BNR17

With equal starting CFUs, the unknown strains have a better chance of competing 
with or even outcompeting your specific therapeutic strains. While the specific 
strains are optimized for 99°F fermentation, competition becomes less predictable 
when starting CFUs are equal. Stick with 1-2 capsules to maintain dominance of 
your core therapeutic strains.
