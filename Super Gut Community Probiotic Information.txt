GENERAL WARNINGS FROM SUPER GUT COMMUNITY:

1. Histamine Sensitivity:
   - If histamine-sensitive, start with tiny amounts (1 tsp) and monitor
   - Multi-strain yogurt may be better tolerated than single-strain

2. Pregnancy/Breastfeeding:
   - Single-strain L. reuteri yogurt may increase oxytocin significantly
   - Multi-strain yogurt is safe (dilutes L. reuteri's oxytocin effect)
   - Safe for pregnancy/breastfeeding when using multi-strain yogurt

3. Starting Probiotics:
   - Start with 1/2 cup daily, building to 1 cup as tolerated
   - Some people may experience mild digestive changes when introducing multiple probiotics
   - Starting with small portions and gradually increasing can help the body adjust

4. Temperature Conflicts:
   - When combining multiple strains, use a temperature that works for all (typically 95-105°F/35-41°C)
   - Your recipe uses 100°F which accommodates all the probiotic strains included

5. No Specific Bad Interactions Mentioned:
   - The Super Gut community has not mentioned specific negative interactions between the probiotics in your recipe
   - Most combinations appear to work synergistically
   - The multi-strain approach is generally recommended

═══════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════════
