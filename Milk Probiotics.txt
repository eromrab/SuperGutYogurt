[N] Pediococcus pentosaceus [59F - 95-104F - 111F] - Improves gut microbiota balance and has antimicrobial properties against harmful bacteria.
[N] Pediococcus acidilactici [59F - 95-104F - 111F] - Helps with nutrient fermentation, supports immune modulation, and prevents pathogen overgrowth.
[N] Weissella paramesenteroides [59F - 86-104F - 111F] - Promotes exopolysaccharide production for gut protection and enhances immune function.
[Y] Bifidobacterium spp. [68F - 97-100F - 115F] - Ferments dietary fibers, produces vitamins, strengthens the gut barrier, and alleviates IBS symptoms.

Probiotics found only in raw goat milk:

[Y] Lactobacillus rhamnosus [59F - 86-104F - 111F] - Prevents traveler's diarrhea, supports oral and vaginal health, and modulates the immune system.
[N] Lactobacillus pentosus [59F - 86-104F - 111F] - Exhibits strong antimicrobial activity, aids cholesterol reduction, and supports anti-allergic responses.
[N] Lactococcus lactis subsp. lactis [50F - 77-86F - 104F] - Produces bacteriocins to inhibit pathogens and enhances mucosal immunity.
[N] Lactococcus lactis subsp. cremoris [50F - 77-86F - 104F] - Contributes to flavor development in fermentation while supporting gut microbial diversity.
[N] Enterococcus faecalis [59F - 86-98.6F - 111F] - Assists in bile salt deconjugation for fat digestion and provides antimicrobial effects against gut pathogens.
[N] Enterococcus durans [59F - 86-98.6F - 111F] - Helps maintain gut homeostasis and shows anti-inflammatory properties in intestinal disorders.
[N] Enterococcus hirae [59F - 86-98.6F - 111F] - Supports quorum sensing in microbiota and aids in preventing enteropathogen adhesion.

Probiotics found in both raw cow and goat milk:

[Y] Lactobacillus plantarum [59F - 86-104F - 111F] - Improves gut barrier function, reduces bloating, and has antioxidant and anti-inflammatory benefits.
[N] Lactobacillus fermentum [59F - 86-104F - 111F] - Enhances iron absorption, supports skin health, and provides cholesterol-lowering effects.
[N] Enterococcus faecium [59F - 86-98.6F - 111F] - Boosts immunity against infections, aids in lactose breakdown, and promotes balanced gut flora.
