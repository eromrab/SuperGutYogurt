CONSPIRACY PROBIOTICS ANALYSIS:

The following probiotics from your Conspiracy Probiotics.txt file were checked against your other lists:

Aspergillus oryzae
• In Known Probiotics: NO
• In Milk Probiotics: NO
• In Recipe: NO
• Why not in lists: NOT a probiotic - this is a FUNGUS (mold) used for fermentation (koji for miso, sake, soy sauce). While it produces beneficial enzymes, it's not classified as a probiotic bacteria. It's a fermentation organism, not typically consumed as a live probiotic.

Rhizopus oligosporus
• In Known Probiotics: NO
• In Milk Probiotics: NO
• In Recipe: NO
• Why not in lists: NOT a probiotic - this is a FUNGUS (mold) used for tempeh fermentation. While it produces beneficial compounds, it's not classified as a probiotic bacteria. It's a fermentation organism specific to tempeh production.

Lactobacillus hilgardii
• In Known Probiotics: NO
• In Milk Probiotics: NO
• In Recipe: NO
• Why not in lists: Specialized fermentation organism primarily found in wine and beer fermentation. Not commonly used in dairy/yogurt fermentation or probiotic supplements. Typically associated with alcoholic beverage production rather than probiotic foods.

Lactobacillus kunkeei
• In Known Probiotics: NO
• In Milk Probiotics: NO
• In Recipe: NO
• Why not in lists: Specialized organism primarily associated with honey bee gut microbiome and honey fermentation. Not commonly found in human gut or dairy fermentation. Limited research on human probiotic benefits.

OTHER MISSING PROBIOTICS:

Based on research, here are other probiotics that may be missing from standard lists:

• Lactobacillus reuteri (other strains besides DSM 17938/ATCC PTA 6475)
• Lactobacillus crispatus (vaginal health focus)
• Lactobacillus jensenii (vaginal health focus)
• Lactobacillus iners (vaginal health focus)
• Lactobacillus vaginalis (vaginal health focus)
• Lactobacillus salivarius subsp. salivarius (oral health focus)
• Bifidobacterium catenulatum
• Bifidobacterium pseudocatenulatum
• Lactobacillus amylovorus
• Lactobacillus amylolyticus
• Lactobacillus amylophilus
• Lactobacillus gallinarum
• Lactobacillus aviarius
• Lactobacillus ingluviei
• Lactobacillus mucosae
• Lactobacillus oris
• Lactobacillus panis
• Lactobacillus pontis
• Lactobacillus sanfranciscensis (sourdough)
• Lactobacillus kefiranofaciens (kefir)
• Lactobacillus kefiri (kefir)
• Lactobacillus parakefiri (kefir)
• Lactobacillus helveticus subsp. jugurti
• Streptococcus salivarius subsp. thermophilus (same as S. thermophilus)
• Leuconostoc citreum
• Leuconostoc gelidum
• Leuconostoc kimchii
• Pediococcus damnosus
• Pediococcus inopinatus
• Weissella cibaria
• Weissella confusa
• Weissella koreensis
• Propionibacterium acnes (some strains beneficial, others pathogenic)
• Clostridium butyricum (now Anaerobutyricum butyricum - spore-forming)
• Eubacterium rectale
• Eubacterium hallii
• Ruminococcus bromii
• Ruminococcus flavefaciens

Note: Many of these are either:
- Very specialized (vaginal, oral, or animal-specific)
- Not commonly available in supplements
- Require specialized fermentation conditions
- Have limited human health research
- Are anaerobic (difficult to culture at home)
