    Health Benefits: Produces butyrate, supports metabolic health, may help with insulin sensitivity (anaerobic, not typically cultured at home)
    Optimal Temperature Range: 98.6°F (37°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions
    Full Temperature Range: 95-105°F (35-41°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions

•   [NNY] Roseburia species
    Health Benefits: Produces butyrate, supports gut health, anti-inflammatory, metabolic health (anaerobic, not typically cultured at home)
    Optimal Temperature Range: 98.6°F (37°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions
    Full Temperature Range: 95-105°F (35-41°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions

•   [NNY] Butyricicoccus pullicaecorum
    Health Benefits: Produces butyrate, may help with IBD, supports gut health (anaerobic, not typically cultured at home)
    Optimal Temperature Range: 98.6°F (37°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions
    Full Temperature Range: 95-105°F (35-41°C) - requires strict anaerobic conditions

•   [NNO] Anaerobutyricum (formerly Clostridium) butyricum
    Health Benefits: Produces butyrate (short-chain fatty acid that provides energy for colon cells, supports gut barrier integrity, has anti-inflammatory properties, regulates immune responses), supports digestive health, may help with diarrhea. Spore-forming allows survival in various conditions, but prefers anaerobic environment for growth (some strains available as probiotic supplements)
    Optimal Temperature Range: 95-104°F (35-40°C) - prefers anaerobic conditions but spore-forming nature provides some tolerance
    Full Temperature Range: 86-113°F (30-45°C) - prefers anaerobic conditions but spore-forming nature provides some tolerance

NOTES ON TEMPERATURE RANGES:

•   Most Lactobacillus species: 95-115°F (35-46°C) with optimal around 98-100°F (37-38°C)
•   Most Bifidobacterium species: 96-100°F (36-38°C) with optimal at 98.6°F (37°C)
•   Thermotolerant strains (S. thermophilus, L. bulgaricus): 104-115°F (40-46°C)
•   Spore-forming Bacillus species: Can tolerate higher temperatures (up to 140°F/60°C)
•   Yeast probiotics: Lower temperatures, 86-98.6°F (30-37°C)

IMPORTANT CONSIDERATIONS:

•   Strain-specific benefits: Different strains within the same species may have different benefits
•   Temperature ranges may vary by specific strain and manufacturer
•   Multi-strain fermentation: When combining strains, use a temperature that works for all (typically 95-105°F/35-41°C)
•   Fermentation time: Longer fermentation (24-36+ hours) generally increases CFU counts
•   Prebiotics: Adding prebiotics (inulin, FOS) helps feed probiotics during fermentation
•   Individual responses vary: Consult healthcare professionals before starting new probiotic regimens

KEY / LEGEND:

First Character (Y/N): In Super Gut SIBO Yogurt Recipe.txt (Y) or NOT (N)
Second Character (Y/N): Recommended for yogurt/cultured food fermentation (Y) or NOT (N)
Third Character (O/Y/N): Can survive at 99°F - O = Optimal, Y = Yes (survivable but not optimal), N = No (cannot survive)

Examples:
[YYO] = In recipe AND recommended for yogurt AND 99°F is optimal
[YYY] = In recipe AND recommended for yogurt AND 99°F is survivable (not optimal)
[YYN] = In recipe AND recommended for yogurt BUT 99°F is NOT survivable
[YNO] = In recipe BUT not recommended for yogurt AND 99°F is optimal
[NYO] = NOT in recipe BUT recommended for yogurt AND 99°F is optimal
[NNN] = NOT in recipe AND not recommended for yogurt AND 99°F is NOT survivable

Health Benefits: Documented health benefits and properties of the probiotic strain
Optimal Temperature Range: The temperature range where the probiotic grows best and produces highest CFU counts during fermentation
Full Temperature Range: The minimum to maximum temperature range where the probiotic can still survive and grow (suboptimal but functional)
Temperature Source: URL or reference where the temperature range data was found
