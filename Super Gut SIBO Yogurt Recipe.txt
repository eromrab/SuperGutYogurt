Super Gut SIBO Yogurt Recipe

This is the simplest version of Dr. William Davis's SIBO yogurt from his book Super Gut, combining L. reuteri (strains DSM 17938 & ATCC PTA 6475), L. gasseri (BNR17), and B. subtilis (HU58 recommended) for targeting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It yields about 8 servings (1 quart batch) and ferments for exactly 36 hours at 99°F to maximize bacterial counts (CFUs). The long ferment reduces lactose to near-zero, making it tolerable for many with dairy sensitivities. Start with 1/2 cup daily, building to 1 cup as tolerated.

Ingredients

Non-Probiotics:
•	2 tablespoons organic inulin powder (prebiotic to feed the bacteria)
•	1 quart organic half-and-half (ultra-pasteurized preferred for creaminess and reliability; avoid low-fat)

Core Super Gut Probiotics:  
•	L. reuteri (MyReuteri by Oxiceutics) (10B CFU; provides L. reuteri) [96-100°F (36-38°C) / 98.6-109.4°F (37-43°C)]

•	L. gasseri BNR17 (10–20 billion CFUs; e.g., from Swanson or similar) [98-100°F (37-38°C)]
•	B. subtilis (10–20 billion CFUs; e.g., Bacillus Subtilis Probiotic Powder - use approximately 1/12 to 1/6 tsp for 10-20B CFUs) [90-95°F (32-35°C) / 95-113°F (35-45°C)]

Enhanced Lactose Breakdown:
•   L. acidophilus (La-14) (10–20 billion CFUs; enhances lactose digestion, supports digestive health, helps maintain healthy gut flora) [95-115°F (35-46°C) / 98.6-107.6°F (37-42°C)]
•   L. casei (Lc-11) (10–20 billion CFUs; supports digestive health, enhances immune function, helps with lactose digestion) [95-115°F (35-46°C) / 98.6-109.4°F (37-43°C)]

General Gut Health:
•   B. bifidum (Bb-02) (10–20 billion CFUs; reduces flatulence and abdominal pain) [98-100°F (37-38°C) / 96.8-100.4°F (36-38°C)]
•   B. lactis (Bl-04) (10–20 billion CFUs; enhances immune response, supports digestive health) [98-100°F (37-38°C)]
•   B. longum (Bl-05) (10–20 billion CFUs; supports overall gut health, helps with constipation) [98-100°F (37-38°C) / 96.8-100.4°F (36-38°C)]

Immune & Oral Health:
•   L. rhamnosus (Lr-32) (10–20 billion CFUs; supports immune function, helps with diarrhea) [95-105°F (35-41°C) / 98.6°F (37°C)]
•   L. salivarius (Ls-33) (10–20 billion CFUs; supports oral and gut health, may help with bad breath) [95-105°F (35-41°C)]

Taste like regular yogurt:
•   S. thermophilus (St-21) (10–20 billion CFUs; creates thick, creamy yogurt texture) [105-115°F (41-46°C) / 107.6-113°F (42-45°C) / 109.4-114.8°F (43-46°C)]

Anti-inflammatory:
•   L. plantarum (10–20 billion CFUs; powerful anti-inflammatory, gut barrier support) [86-100°F (30-38°C) / 53.6-104°F (12-40°C)]
•   L. brevis (10–20 billion CFUs; cognitive health, memory support, anti-inflammatory) [86-104°F (30-40°C)]
•   L. bulgaricus (10–20 billion CFUs; reduces proinflammatory cytokines, strong anti-inflammatory) [104-113°F (40-45°C) / 109.4-114.8°F (43-46°C)]

Starter Follow up Batches:
•	2 tablespoons previous SIBO yogurt (as starter) or
•	1/4 to 1/2 cup or all whey from previous strained batch
•	1–2 tablespoons inulin powder  
•	1 quart organic half-and-half
•	Note: Whey is less concentrated than yogurt, so use 2-4x more volume. Whey starter can be used for multiple batches - monitor quality and refresh with fresh probiotics when fermentation weakens. Whey mixes more evenly than yogurt starter.

Equipment
•	Mixing bowl and whisk
•	Yogurt incubator
•	Glass jars for storage

Step-by-Step Instructions
1.	Open the MyReuteri capsule and empty the L. gasseri capsule into a mixing bowl. Add B. subtilis powder (approximately 1/12 to 1/6 tsp).
2.	Add 2 tbsp inulin and 2 tbsp half-and-half to the powders; whisk into a smooth slurry.
3.	Pour in the remaining half-and-half and whisk thoroughly to combine.
4.	Pour into clean jars, cover loosely (e.g., with plastic wrap), and place in the incubator at exactly 99°F.
5.	Ferment undisturbed for 36 hours (start in the morning or evening for convenience; don't shorten, as strains peak after 24 hours).
6.	Refrigerate immediately after fermenting. It will thicken further in the fridge and store for up to 2 weeks. 

For Greek-Style Yogurt (Optional):
7.	Line a fine-mesh strainer or colander with cheesecloth, coffee filter, or nut milk bag.
8.	Place strainer over a bowl and pour the fermented yogurt into it.
9.	Refrigerate and let strain for 2-6 hours (longer = thicker yogurt).
10.	Save the whey for smoothies, baking, or as a probiotic drink.
11.	Transfer strained yogurt to a clean container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

Tips
•	Texture/Taste: Expect thick, tangy, cheese-like yogurt (not sweet like store-bought). Separation is normal—stir or strain as needed.
•	Scaling: Double ingredients for larger batches if needed.
•	Safety: Safe for pregnancy/breastfeeding (multi-strain dilutes L. reuteri's oxytocin effect). If histamine-sensitive, start tiny (1 tsp) and monitor.
•	Reculturing: Use previous batch as starter for 4–6 cycles until it thins or sours oddly, then restart with fresh probiotics.
