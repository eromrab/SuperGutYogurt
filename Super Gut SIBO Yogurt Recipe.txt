Super Gut SIBO Yogurt Recipe

This is my modified version of Dr. William Davis's SIBO yogurt from his book Super Gut, combining Lactobacillus reuteri (strains DSM 17938 & ATCC PTA 6475), Lactobacillus gasseri (BNR17), and Bacillus subtilis (HU58 recommended) for targeting small intestinal bacterial overgrowth (SIBO). It yields about 8 servings (1 quart batch) and ferments for exactly 36 hours at 99°F to maximize bacterial counts (CFUs). 
The long ferment reduces lactose to near-zero, making it tolerable for many with dairy sensitivities. 
Start with 1/2 cup daily, building to 1 cup as tolerated.

Starter Follow up Batches:
•	2 tablespoons previous SIBO yogurt (as starter) or
•	1/4 to 1/2 cup or all whey from previous strained batch
•	1–2 tablespoons inulin powder  
•	1 quart organic half-and-half
•	Note: Whey is less concentrated than yogurt, so use 2-4x more volume. Whey starter can be used for multiple batches - monitor quality and refresh with fresh probiotics when fermentation weakens. Whey mixes more evenly than yogurt starter.

Equipment
•	Mixing bowl and whisk
•	Yogurt incubator
•	Glass jars for storage

Step-by-Step Instructions
1.	Open the MyReuteri capsule and empty the Lactobacillus gasseri capsule into a mixing bowl. Add Bacillus subtilis powder (approximately 1/12 to 1/6 tsp).
2.	Add 2 tbsp inulin and 2 tbsp half-and-half to the powders; whisk into a smooth slurry.
3.	Pour in the remaining half-and-half and whisk thoroughly to combine.
4.	Pour into clean jars, cover loosely (e.g., with plastic wrap), and place in the incubator at exactly 99°F.
5.	Ferment undisturbed for 36 hours (start in the morning or evening for convenience; don't shorten, as strains peak after 24 hours).
6.	Refrigerate immediately after fermenting. It will thicken further in the fridge and store for up to 2 weeks. 

For Greek-Style Yogurt (Optional):
7.	Line a fine-mesh strainer or colander with cheesecloth, coffee filter, or nut milk bag.
8.	Place strainer over a bowl and pour the fermented yogurt into it.
9.	Refrigerate and let strain for 2-6 hours (longer = thicker yogurt).
10.	Save the whey for smoothies, baking, or as a probiotic drink.
11.	Transfer strained yogurt to a clean container and refrigerate for up to 2 weeks.

Tips
•	Texture/Taste: Expect thick, tangy, cheese-like yogurt (not sweet like store-bought). Separation is normal—stir or strain as needed.
•	Scaling: Double ingredients for larger batches if needed.
•	Safety: Safe for pregnancy/breastfeeding (multi-strain dilutes Lactobacillus reuteri's oxytocin effect). If histamine-sensitive, start tiny (1 tsp) and monitor.
•	Reculturing: Use previous batch as starter for 4–6 cycles until it thins or sours oddly, then restart with fresh probiotics.
